<h1>The Town</h1>
<body>
  <h3>After wandering the whole Earth, I find myself within the town. <br><br> It's a small town, but very peaceful. I can let my mind rest, and tell   stories about my long adventures to anyone who wants to know <br><br> It offers a nice break from the storms (homework) winds (tests) and hurricanes    (exams) of this giant place (school).
  <br><br> I like it. It's peaceful. <br><br> I was introduced to the town through <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/">Shan-Mei</a>.   <br><br>She's really nice and helped me set up my library. <br><br> I'm quite new to the town and don't know many people, but I hear from Shan-Mei     that they are all really nice. <br><br> We live within the town, and have very interesting houses.</h3>
