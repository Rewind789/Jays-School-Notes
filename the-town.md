title: "The Town"
---

There are 21 people in the town... some people left I guess? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

After wandering, I find myself in the town, where I now rest...It's good to rest after a while. No place better to live than a desert...woo?
I like it...it's peaceful...to peaceful...
I was introduced through [Shan-mei](https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/), and I'm also good friends with [pi-thagoras](https://pi-thagoras.github.io/the-chicken-pen) (why is there a dash inbetween ahahaha)
