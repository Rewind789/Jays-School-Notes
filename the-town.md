<h1>The Town</h1>
<body>
  <h3>After wandering, I find myself in the town, where I now rest...It's good to rest after a while. No place better to live in than a desert...woo?
  <br><br> I like it. It's peaceful. <br><br> I was introduced to the town through <a href="https://shan-mei.github.io/shanmeis-notes/">Shan-Mei</a>.   <br><br>I'm also friends with <a href:"pi-thagoras.github.io/the-chicken-pen/">Pi-Thagoras</a>...
  </h3>

  <br>
  <h2>There are 21 people in the town...(some people left i guess? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯)</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>There is <br> also... (unfinished....)</h3>
