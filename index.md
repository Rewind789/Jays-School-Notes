_[A page of his diary, of his adventures to every place on Earth. With every experience he ever had, all written in pen and paper...]_

Hi! Welcome to my vast inventory, here in this labyrinth of scrolls and artifacts, each one organised neatly, may you find many different notes (if you look in the right place and don't get lost). Each and every one is different and exquisite in its own way...chemistry, physics, etc. Enjoy your stay in this library; don't get lost~

WHY IS THIS NOT SYNCING....I'm getting schizophrenia...
> caused by music

My inventory and library are currently in an establishment within the [Town](/wanderer-archive/the-town.md), an oasis where I rest and wander no further (even though I'm a wanderer....)

Leaving so quickly? Bored to death? Good-bye my visitors... if you don't want to get lost you can visit the [town](/wanderer-archive/the-town.md) where other member's notes are stored...

Also check out my [iventory](https://wanderer-inventory.notion.site/Wanderer-s-Archive-551bf6d3382148678191175b1123296f) where my scrolls are carefully organised and written (down at the moment sry :/)
  
Have fun in this library! ~Kiefer Yuen
