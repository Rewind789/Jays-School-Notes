title: "Boring Presentations"
---

What makes a boring presentation? What motivates a bunch of year 10 students to actively pay attention to everything that a presenter says?

I can never imagine myself fully concentrating on any talks about procrastination (and in fact, I stalled violin lessons once to skip **procrastination busters**)
- IM SORRY, but I just cannot muster the energy at times

Anyway, what motivates people to listen to these talks?
