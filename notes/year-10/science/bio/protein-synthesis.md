## Genetic Code
- The genetic code of an organism is the sequence of the bases
- A polypeptide (lots of these nucleotides), made from amino acids, are a sequence of bases in a gene code
- These codes are almost universal; the same codes for the same amino acids across all organisms (AUG = methionine in all organisms)
