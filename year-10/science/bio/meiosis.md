title: "Meiosis"

Meiosis, the splitting of cells that result in genetic variation and are exclusively for our sex cells.
- Sperm cells for males and ovum for females; these are the sex cells

## Haploid Gametes
All somatic (body) cells in multicellular organisms are genetically identical due to mitosis
- All descended from a zygote
> Zygote forms when two haploid/gametes fuse; gametes are genetically different because they are formed from mitosis

Haploid: 1 copy of each chromosome (chromosomes 1-23), and diploid means that there are 2 copies of each chromosome

During cell division, only 1 chromosome from each homologous (same) pair is copied; results in only 23 cells.

## Meiosis
Gametes are from cell division called **meiosis**
- This produces 4 daughter cells and results iin diversity and variation (all daughter cells rae haploids)
- Quite different from mitosis, in that there is crossing over and independent assortment
- Crossing over: when the chromosomes line up in the middle, they swap over a bit of genetic information, which cause variation
- Independent Assortment: In meiosis I, one chromosome from each pair goes to one of the cells while the other goes to another; this is completely random

Meiosis I
- Homologous pairs of chromosomes align in the middle of the parent cell and are separated
- Cell divides so each new daughter cells only contain one chromosome from each pair; 23 in total
- Introduces genetic diversity by randomly dividing a cell's genes into 2; results in 2 haploid cells

Meiosis II
- Chromosomes align and its chromatids are moved to opposite ends
- Splits each chromosome into 2 chromatids and places 1 in each cell
- Results in 4 unique haploid genes
