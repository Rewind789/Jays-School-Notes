The world of mitosis! Where one cell splits into 2...

sounds like an efficient way to do things but sure...¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ it works i guess

## Cell Division
Why do cells reproduce? What is the point?

Organisms need to reproduce and replace old/damaged cells other organisms would be unicellular[^1]

Cell division is also needed for sexual reproduction and growth.

## Cell Cycle
Eukaryotic cells divide in 2 ways
- Mitosis: divides into 2 daughter cells that are genetically identical to each other and parent cells
- Meiosis: [Click here](/year-10/science/bio/meiosis.md)

There is a cell cycle that cells follow, which is known as IPMAT

## Rest Phase; Interphase
Cells often stop dividing one they are fully differentiated; specialised cells move from G1 to G0 (resting phases)

Cells may remain in G0 for the rest of its lifetime, or maybe just temporarily

G0 is also the phase in which stem cells wait until their associated body cells need replacing

## Mitosis: Dividing and growing
The type of division that makes animals and plants grow is mitosis

A parent cell divides into two daughter cells[^2]
> The way which old and damaged cells are replaced

Normally, a cell only contains one copy of each chromosomes - before dividing chromosomes are duplicated

## Duplication
Cell chromosomes are usually a long thin strand; but for a part of interphase, they condense and each chromosome duplicates (via DNA replication!) and become 2 strands, each one called a chromatid; the two are joined at the centromere.

[in progress]


[^1]: Made of 1 cell only
[^2]: Only 2 cells remain! The mother cell is divided and ceases to exist; there ARE NOT 3 cells (sounds dumb, but someone told me that it was a common mistake)
