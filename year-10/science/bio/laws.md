Gregor Mendel (1830-1860s)

Gregor Mendel, the scientist who wrote Mendel's laws of inheritence. He was a genetist who studied the forms of inheritence through the experimentation of pea plants (he was weird). He determined that traits depend on separate factors from parents to offspring.

He looked at characteristics; colour, shapes, seeds etc.

## Monohybrid Cross
2 alleles controlling one trait. E.g. either smooth or wrinkled leaves. You use [punnett squares](punnett-squares.md) to find the probabilities of these with both of the parent genotypes.
