title: "Allele Inheritence"
---

## Gregor Mendel (1830s - 1860s)
- Experimented with pea plants; he used them to study genetics
- Determined that traits depend on separate factors from parents to offspring; and the modes of inheritence
- He looked at characteristics such as colours, shapes of ods, seeds etc. to conclude his results

He used a monohybrid cross
- This is where 2 alleles contain one trait; for example, the only alleles that control pea pod surfaces are the smooth allele and wrinkled allele (smooth allele = smooth pods)

## Gregor Mendel's Laws
Laws of segregation
- Inherits 2 alleles from both parents (1 allele from each parent)
- Dominant allele overrides recessive alleles
- Two factors separate during meiosis
- Alternative variations cause different characteristics

Laws of independent assortment
- The obtainment of an allele is afftected by nothing else; just up to chance

Laws of Dominance and Recessiveness
- Dominant > recessive basically

## Pedigrees
Pedigrees are a sort of diagram used to show a family history of a trait

## Co-dominance and Incomplete
Co-dominance
- Make extra phenotype; 3 phenotypes
- For example, there are 3 types of blood cells, A, B and O
- A and B are dominant while O is recessive
- AB is co-dominant; it is when both A and B are expressed (because they are both dominant and are expressed)

Incomplete
- Neither are fully dominant over the other
- A and B are neither dominant nor recessive
- Blend together into a mix; combine for a new outcome

Comparing the two:

Here is an example... with my favourite animal, a kitten!

Co-dominant: White cat and black cat produce a cat with black and white patches

Incomplete: white cat and black cat blend together and form a gray cat
