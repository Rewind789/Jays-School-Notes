People inherit different traits from parents, they are determined by
- Set of genes inherited from parents (nature)
- The environment where they developed (nurture)

## Characteristics
Some characteristics (for example, height, eye colour, ear shapes etc.) are dependent on genes

They can be acquired through environmental factors (e.g. hair length, scars) or determined by your genes in your DNA

These observable characteristics are called **phenotypes**
> A full set of genes is called a genotype (a combination of alleles that you have)
> These are represented through capital and lower case letters. So the possibilities are AA (inherited an A from both parents), aa (inherited an a from both parents), and Aa (inherited A from one parent and an a from the other)

AA - homozygous dominant, aa - recessive dominant, Aa - heterozygous

There are two types of characteristics: continuous and discontinuous

Continuous are measured in a range of values (e.g. height); discontinuous means that there are one of a few options (e.g. eye colour)
