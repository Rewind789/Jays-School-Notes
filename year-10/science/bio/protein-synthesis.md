## Genetic Code
- The genetic code of an organism is the sequence of the bases
- A polypeptide (lots of these nucleotides), made from amino acids, are a sequence of bases in a gene code
- These codes are almost universal; the same codes for the same amino acids across all organisms (AUG = methionine in all organisms)
- The order of the four bases make up the genetic code

## Codon/Triplet Code
A set of 3 in the genetic code is called a triplet on the DNA strand, and called a codon on the mRNA strand
These codons code for a specific amino acid
>Confirmed by Francis Crick; each triplet is degenerate, so that 1 or more triplets can code for each amino acid)

## mRNA (messenger RNA)
mRNA is a single strand of replicated DNA; it has the sugar ribose instead of deoxyribose and instead of Thymine, it has Uracil[^1]
When a polypeptide is required, the triple code of its gene is converted into mRNA strand which goes to a ribosome to code for the amino acid

Steps to protein synthesis[^2]

## Transcription
DNA is too big to leave the nucleus, so it has to be transcribed with only the necessary gene information
RNA polymerase unwinds the DNA around 17 bases at a time, and copies the DNA using the 3' to 5' strand of the DNA. 
> Adenine bonds with Uracil; Guanine bonds with Cytosine} uracil replaces thymine

## RNA processing
Splicing
- In the gene, there are two types of "chunks"
- Introns: useless, exons: useful
- In DNA splicing, spliceosome cuts up the mRNA strand and sticks the exons together, while leaving the introns out

5' methylated Guanine cap
- A modified methylated guanine cap is added to the 5' end of the mRNA strand (think of it as a helmet)
- This stops it from being degraded by enzymes in the cytoplasm, and essentially protects it

Poly-A tail
- This is a tail added at the end of the mRNA strand, consisting of around 30-200 Adenine bases
- This protects it and makes it more stable to exit the nucleus
- Adenine is better to use as a tail because the mRNA strand will have to degrade eventually, and Adenine is easily degradable; another cap would take longer to get rid of

## Translation
Once the mRNA is transcribed, it moves out of the nucleus via the nuclear pores

In the cytoplasm, mRNA combines with a ribosome {this is where mRNA codes for a polypeptide chain}

Transfer RNA looks like T's that carry an amino acid

Each tRNA has a complememtary codon to the codon on the RNA, the ribosome finds the tRNA with the matching anti-codon and brings it; the amino acid the tRNA is carrying will be dropped off (E.g. AUG codes for methionine)




[^1]: Uracil is more degradeable (the mRNA strand will have to degrade after done its job), because Guanine is protected by an oxygen molecule
[^2]: More refined notes are on the Protein Synthesis CAT page; this is just a basis for understanding
