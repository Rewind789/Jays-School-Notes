Punnett squares are how we work out if the offspring will express which trait.

## Recap of Dominant and Recessive traits
Dominant and Recessive traits
- Dominant traits are represented with capital letters (e.g. A)
- Recessive traits are lower case (e.g. a)
- Dominant will always be expressed over recessive traits (so if brown eyes were dominant, then if there was a brown eye allele then the child would have brown eyes. The blue eyes can only be expressed if there are 2 blue eyes and no brown eyes alleles. The blue eyes would be recessive in this case)
