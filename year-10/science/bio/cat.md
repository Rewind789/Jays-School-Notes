#### Transcription

1. Initiation; RNA polymerase binds to the promotor sites of the DNA strand, these are where the important information and codons are held
2. After this, RNA polymerase and topoisomerase unwinds the DNA in the direction of 5â€™ to 3â€™
3. Elongation; When it reaches the coding section, RNA polymerase adds complementary bases to the nucleotide chain synthesising in a 5â€™ to 3â€™ direction to create a new messenger RNA (mRNA) strand
    1. 3â€™ to 5â€™ strand is known as template strand or sense strand; this is the one that is being copied
    2. Instead of Thymine, Uracil is used in the mRNA strand (thymine is harder to degrade due to an oxygen; uracil means that it can degrade faster and easily)
4. Termination; When it reaches the stop codon (ATT on the template strand), the mRNA strand breaks free; the mRNA folds on itself to prevent further transcription
5. DNA ligase rewinds the DNA back into the double helix structure

#### RNA processing

1. RNA splicing 
    1. The pre-mRNA (the one that was just made) becomes a mature RNA strand after RNA splicing
    2. This is where the useless parts of the mRNA (introns) are cut out and the remaining useful parts (exons) are stuck together; these exons are the ones that code for the amino acids; the exons are stuck together by DNA ligase again
    3. Sometimes, alternative splicing is used; this is where the exons in the mRNA strand are rearranged to form new and different types of polypeptides
2. A 5â€™ methylated altered guanine cap is added to the 5â€™ end of the RNA strand, this helps to protect the mRNA strand from being degraded by enzymes in the cytoplasm
3. A Poly-A tail, which has around 30-200 Adenine nucleotides is added to the end of the mRNA strand
    1. This makes the mRNA strand more stable so that it can leave the nuclear pores
    2. After finishing its work, the mRNA strand needs to degrade completely, and Adenine can easily degrade so this tail ensures that the strand will be degradable but also protecting the mRNA strand, instead of being undegradable if there was another methylated cap
4. After RNA processing, the newly formed mRNA strand leaves via the nuclear pores

#### Translation

1. After leaving the nucleus, the mRNA strand finds a ribosome (rRNA) to bind to; ribosomes are found free-floating in the cytoplasm, or on the rough-endoplasmic reticulum
    1. Ribosomes are black circle-like structures that are formed in the nucleolus
    2. There are plenty of them around
    3. They make proteins
2. The ribosome binds to the mRNA strand and the transfer RNA (tRNA) 
    1. tRNA is an RNA molecule that carries amino acids; they have an anti-codon at the bottom
3. Ribosome looks for the start codon (sets of 3 nucleotides), AUG on the mRNA strand; this one tells it to start from that codon and continue reading after that
    1. AUG calls for the amino acid methionine 
4. The ribosome reads one codon at a time, getting a tRNA with an matching anti-codon to come and gives the corresponding amino acid 
    
    
    1. The ribosome reads a codon at a time; each tRNA has an anti-codon (the opposite nucleotides) and by recognising the base pairs and looking for the anti-codon, the ribosome calls for the matching tRNA which carries the amino acid
    1. E.g. AUG (start codon) will have the anti-codon UAC, and the ribosome will call for the tRNA that has the anti-codon UAC, which carries a methionine amino acid
5. This keeps cycling until it reaches a stop codon (for example, UAA, UGA and UAG)
6. The amino acids in the chain bond together from a chemical reaction from the ribosome

Protein Structure

1. A polypeptide chain either joins with another polypeptide chain or folds on itself, or does both; this shape the chain makes is dictated by the protein(and sequence of amino acids) it is trying to create. Hydrogen bonds form to help create the shape needed.
2. The Golgi apparatus modifies and packages the proteins (if needed)
