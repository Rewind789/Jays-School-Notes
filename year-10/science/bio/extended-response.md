title: Biology Extended Responses
---

Biology extended response sections exist; these are where there are long paragraphs to write about a process... and hopefully you don't want to fail; so here are some "hints" given by our teacher.

## Keywords
Utilise keywords to make sure you directly answer the language
Correct scientific language is necessary to get marks
Plan answer by writing a list of key ideas and languages and sort them
- Make it factual; don't make your extended responses interesting; the teacher has to mark it based on facts no matter how boring it is

Define keywords if necessary
Analyse the verbs in the question and directly answer it
>e.g. Compare: talking about similarities _and_ differences

Diagrams!!

## Other
Do NOT use an introduction or conclusion
Can use dot points (but they have to be elaborated)
- Tables can also be used; if they are elaborated

A 10 mark questions should take no longer than 12-15 minutes (maximum)

Hopefully you won't fail... the protein synthesis CAT is mean :(
