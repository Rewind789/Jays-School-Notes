title: "Finding the mode of inheritance"

Finding the mode of inheritences can be hard, so here are some easy pointers to find them quickly.

## Autosomal Dominant
- If two affected parents have a unaffected child, then it has to be dominant
- Both parents are Aa and Aa (so they express the trait) but they luckily pass the a trait so the child is aa, and is unaffected


## Autosomal Recessive
- If two unaffeced parents have an affected child, then the condition is recessive (or sex linked)
- Both parents are heterozygous, and pass either one or both dominant alleles down so the child is unaffected

## Sex Linked

## Otherwise
